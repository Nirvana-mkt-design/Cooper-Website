   White Paper — "The AI Advantage for Insurance Agents."

   Layout: an article column with a form rail beside it, after the
   reference set for gated papers (Figma's Forrester report, Sprout
   Social, Mural, Deel).
     1. Key takeaways box (the exec-summary bullets) at the top of the
        article column.
     2. The gate form in the rail, sticky, in view the whole way down.
     3. The executive summary, then the paper behind the gate, with a
        second CTA over the blur for the reader who has scrolled past
        the rail on a phone.
     4. A closing CTA banner (matches the Integrations / Careers banner).

   Gutters are the navbar's 62px rather than the 85px this page used, so
   the rail's right edge lands on the same margin as Request a Demo and
   the hero's eyebrow lines up under the logo.

   Gated per Amar, Jul 31, superseding the ungated Jul 21 decision: the
   visitor leaves a name, work email, company and phone before the body
   opens, same fields as the demo form.

   What "gated" means here is worth being precise about, because the
   first pass at it was not a gate. It rendered the whole paper and put
   `blur-[6px]` over it, so the text sat in the client bundle and, since
   the route is prerendered, in the static HTML too — 3,900 words that
   `curl` returned with no JavaScript and no form. Deleting one class in
   devtools was the entire bypass.

   So the split is now physical rather than visual:

     · the executive summary lives in src/content/white-paper-preview.md,
       ships to the browser, and stays indexable — it is the teaser;
     · the rest lives in api/_white-paper-body.ts, which only the
       serverless function imports, and arrives over the wire after
       api/white-paper.ts has seen the upstream lead call succeed;
     · the locked state renders a skeleton, not the paper. There is no
       hidden text to reveal, so there is nothing a devtools user can do
       that a form-filler could not.

   scripts/assert-gate.cjs fails the build if the body ever turns up in
   dist/ again.

   already converted, never the thing keeping anyone out: an empty cache costs a
   form, and a forged one buys markdown the server would have handed over anyway.

   Read through useSyncExternalStore rather than an effect. The page is
   prerendered, so the HTML always says "locked"; reading storage during render
   would contradict that HTML at hydration, and reading it in an effect would
   flash the locked state at a returning reader. getServerSnapshot answers null

   A — the form in a rail beside the paper, with a card over the blurred

   B — no rail and no card. A screenful of the paper with nothing asked, then
       the page dissolving into a panel that rises from the bottom, the way a
       metered article on Every or the New York Times ends.

   C — no withholding on the page at all. Findings, a summary and a statement
       of what the paper covers, all in the open, with the cover and the form
       in a rail beside them. Ramp's report page. It lives in
       WhitePaperReport.tsx, because it shares a hero with neither of the
       others.

   C is what /resources/white-paper serves. It was picked over the other two
   after all three were built and looked at, and it is also the one that gives
   the most away for free, which makes it the one search engines can read.

   A and B stay reachable at ?gate=a and ?gate=b rather than being deleted:
   they are the comparison the choice was made against, and every lead already
   carries which of the three converted it, so a real split test is a bucketing
   decision away rather than a rebuild. If they are not wanted, deleting them is
   this constant, three components and their branches.

   prerendering: getServerSnapshot answers with the default, and the browser
   corrects it after hydration rather than contradicting the markup during

/* ── The paper's cover.

   Every comparable page shows the document itself beside the headline —
   AngelList, Webflow, Mural, Figma's Forrester report, Ramp — and the absence
   of it was the structural gap in the feedback.

   Shown as a printed object, because a gated download reads as more substantial
   when it looks like a thing that exists.

   The object is CSS, not photography — which is how Webflow does it, and their
   markup is the argument for it: their asset is a flat 1300×1920 cover and the
   book is an `.ebook-cover` wrapper with an `.ebook-cover_overlay` on top,
   carrying the rounding, the gutter shading and the shadow.

   A photographed mockup would have been easier to make and worse to own. It
   bakes in a backdrop, so it only composites on the one page colour it was lit
   for and every other background needs a re-render. It bakes in an angle, and
   this one has to be square on. It bakes in a resolution. And swapping the
   artwork later means re-shooting rather than replacing a file.

   Flat artwork plus CSS has none of that: the image is the cover and nothing
   else, and the object is markup.

   The gutter is two overlays rather than one. A single dark gradient reads as a
   smudge; a hard hairline at the very edge plus a soft falloff beside it reads
   as a spine, because that is what the eye is actually looking for — the fold,
   and then the page curving away from it.

   The artwork is the designed cover, typography and all. Nothing here draws on
   top of it — the earlier version set the type in markup because the artwork it
   had was AI-generated and came back in a typeface the site does not own. This
   one is set in Cooper's own faces already, so overlaying anything would be
   drawing a second title over the real one. ── */

/* ── The locked state.

   Shapes rather than prose, and the distinction is the whole point: none of
   this carries text, so the blur is decoration over nothing instead of a
   curtain over something. Un-blurring it in devtools yields grey rectangles.

   The first pass drew each line as one solid bar, which is why it looked
   cheap — a solid bar blurs into a smear, and a stack of smears reads as
   "content is loading". Blurred writing does not look like that. What the eye
   recognises is the rhythm of words: short runs of ink separated by gaps, of
   uneven length, with the gaps landing in different places on every line. So
   each line here is a row of word-shaped segments, and at 7px of blur they
   melt into something that reads as a page of out-of-focus text.

   The rest of the realism is in the irregularity — headings shorter than body
   lines, paragraphs of different depths, an indented run standing in for a
   list, an occasional denser segment where bold type would sit, and last lines
   that stop short. Every width is hard-coded rather than generated: this
   renders during prerender and again in the browser, and anything random would

          Demo button. The pair used to sit inside a 1040px article, which left
          a band of dead cream down the right and made this page read narrower
          than every other one on the site.

          Three grid children rather than a row of two and prose underneath.
          That earlier shape meant the takeaways and the form formed a row whose
          height the form set, so the summary began below the taller of the two
          and a gap of empty page opened under the takeaways. Here the article
          is one continuous column and the rail spans both of its rows, which
          also gives `sticky` something to travel through: a grid item's
          containing block is its grid area, so a rail spanning row 1 to row 2
          follows the reader down the article. Spanning with items-start rather
          than stretching is what leaves that travel available.

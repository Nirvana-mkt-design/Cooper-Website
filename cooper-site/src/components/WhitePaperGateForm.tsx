   Layout A — the gate as a card in the rail beside the paper.

   Reference pattern, checked against how the category actually does it
   (Figma's Forrester TEI report, Mural, ClickUp, Deel, Intercom,
   Sprout Social): the form sits on the page beside the headline rather
   than behind a button. It costs the visitor no click to see what is
   being asked, and four ordinary fields fit in a card.

   Layout A carries a second way in — the card over the blurred
   remainder opens WhitePaperGateModal — because a reader who has
   scrolled that far has left this one behind and should not have to
   hunt back up the page for it.

   Everything except the frame comes from WhitePaperGateFields.

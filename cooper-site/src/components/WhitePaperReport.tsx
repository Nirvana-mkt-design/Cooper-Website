   Layout C — the report page, after Ramp's Business Spending Report.

   The third answer to the same question, and the one that argues least
   with the reader. A and B both withhold: A blurs the remainder behind
   a rail form, B cuts the page off and raises a panel. C withholds
   nothing but the paper itself. It gives the findings in full and in the
   open, and asks for an address only for the rest.

   The bet: a visitor who has read four real findings knows whether the
   paper is worth their address. A visitor with only blurred text is
   being asked to bet on writing they cannot read. The summary still
   trails off into blur, but by then it is a signal that there is more
   rather than the only thing on offer.

   The structure is Ramp's, near enough beat for beat:

     kicker      icon, "White Paper", a double slash, the edition
     headline    then a standfirst, then a rule
     findings    a labelled list, one specific icon per item
     summary     the public opening, trailing off into blur
     rail        the cover, standing in a lit scene
     gate        the panel from layout B, rising at the foot of the page

   The icons are the detail worth being careful about: each one has to
   mean its own line rather than decorate it, or the column turns into
   three identical bullets wearing different hats.

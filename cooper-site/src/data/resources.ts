   The draft gate is gone from all four places it lived: this list, the route
   and the dynamic import in App.tsx, and the prerender list. It now ships like
   any other resource, with a prerendered page and an entry in the sitemap.

   Its figures come from Akhilesh's brief rather than from measured customer
   results, and the page says so in "The method". Read the source note at the
   top of src/data/cooperEffect.ts before touching any number on it. */
